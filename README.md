# Dependency

This project, Dependency, was initially developed for the PS4. It serves as a utility tool. I created it while enlisting the help of a friend for testing purposes. While I may revise and enhance it in the future, currently, I don't have an immediate use for it. Therefore, I've decided to make it open source.

# Details

This project primarily relies on the package available at https://github.com/Jay184/PyPS4debug as it serves as the main component written in Python. While my knowledge in Python is limited (so please refrain from overly criticizing it, as there may be areas for improvement).
